# Machine Learning.
This repository contains the implementation of different machine algorithms using scientific computing libraries numpy and scipy.

## Usage
### This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Data
> Data required to run the algorithm is already inside the directories, algorithms will load the data and do the training in data after that it can make predictions on test data.

* First clone this project to your machine
* install the packages in requirements file using command 
  > pip install -r requirements.txt
* Move inside any Algorithm model and run it using command
    > python python_file.py
